## What Was Built

### 1. Core Services

#### **PerplexityService** (`src/services/perplexity.js`)
- Real-time market research using Perplexity API
- Methods for forex, crypto, commodities research
- Breaking news detection
- Retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
- Rate limit detection and handling
- Citations support

#### **MarketDataService** (`src/services/market-data.js`)
- Multi-source market data aggregator
- **Forex APIs**:
  - Alpha Vantage (paid, 25 req/day free tier)
  - ExchangeRate-API (free, unlimited)
- **Crypto APIs**:
  - CoinGecko (free, 50 req/min)
- **Commodities APIs**:
  - Metals.live (free, unlimited for gold/silver)
- In-memory caching (5-minute TTL)
- Automatic fallback to free APIs

### 2. Core Utilities

#### **EventDetector** (`src/utils/event-detector.js`)
- Detects breaking news and market-moving events
- Categorizes events: critical, high, medium, low
- Keywords: Fed decisions, rate changes, market crashes, wars, defaults
- Market impact pattern detection (percentage changes, all-time highs/lows)
- Time sensitivity analysis

#### **UrgencyScorer** (`src/utils/urgency-scorer.js`)
- Scores events 1-10 based on market impact
- **Score 8+** triggers content override
- Factors:
  - Event category (critical/high/medium/low)
  - Price change percentage
  - Trading volume
  - Time decay
- Generates urgency reports

### 3. Main Agent

#### **MarketResearchAgent** (`src/agents/market-research.js`)
- Orchestrates all research operations
- Methods:
  - `researchForex(pairs)` - Research forex markets
  - `researchCrypto(symbols)` - Research cryptocurrencies
  - `researchCommodities(commodities)` - Research commodities
  - `monitorBreakingNews()` - Scan for critical events
  - `researchEvent(event)` - Analyze specific events
  - `comprehensiveScan(targets)` - Full market scan
- Generates summaries and recommendations

### 4. Testing

#### **Test Suite** (`tests/test-research.js`)
- 10 comprehensive test cases
- **7/10 passing** (Perplexity API tests require valid credentials)

## Urgency Scoring System

### Score Ranges

| Score | Level | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------|-------------|----------|
| 9-10 | CRITICAL | Immediate override | Fed emergency, market crash 10%+, war |
| 7-8 | HIGH | Override recommended | Fed meetings, trade wars, sanctions |
| 5-6 | MEDIUM | Monitor closely | Inflation data, jobs reports |
| 1-4 | LOW | Background info | Technical analysis, general commentary |

### Override Threshold: **8+**

When an event scores 8 or higher, the system recommends overriding scheduled content to cover the breaking news.

---

## Usage Examples

### 1. Research Forex Market

```javascript
const MarketResearchAgent = require('./src/agents/market-research');
const agent = new MarketResearchAgent();

const result = await agent.researchForex(['EUR/USD', 'GBP/USD']);
console.log(result.summary);
// "Found 5 event(s) including 1 critical event(s) across 2 market(s)"

if (result.shouldOverride) {
  console.log('URGENT: Override scheduled content!');
}
```

### 2. Monitor Breaking News

```javascript
const result = await agent.monitorBreakingNews();
console.log(result.report);
/*
=== URGENCY REPORT ===
⚠️  2 CRITICAL EVENT(S) - OVERRIDE RECOMMENDED
🔴 [9/10] Federal Reserve announces emergency rate cut...
🟠 [8/10] Markets crash 10% in the last hour...
*/
```

### 3. Comprehensive Market Scan

```javascript
const result = await agent.comprehensiveScan({
  forex: ['EUR/USD', 'GBP/USD', 'USD/JPY'],
  crypto: ['BTC', 'ETH', 'XRP'],
  commodities: ['gold', 'oil']
});

console.log(result.topEvents.slice(0, 5));
```

## Dependencies

```json
{
  "axios": "^1.12.2",    // HTTP requests
  "dotenv": "^17.2.3"    // Environment configuration
}
```

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Verify Perplexity API endpoint** - The provided API key may need endpoint validation
2. **Test with real API calls** - Run live tests with actual market data
3. **Set up monitoring** - Track API response times and error rates

### Production Deployment
1. **Upgrade to paid APIs** for production:
   - Alpha Vantage Premium ($49.99/month)
   - CoinGecko Pro ($129/month)
2. **Implement distributed caching** (Redis)
3. **Set up webhook notifications** for critical events (score 9+)
4. **Add logging and monitoring** (Winston, Prometheus)

### Integration
1. **Connect to video generation pipeline**
2. **Implement content override logic**
3. **Create scheduling system** that respects urgency scores

---

## Known Issues

1. **Perplexity API Endpoint** - Returns 400 error, may need:
   - Endpoint verification
   - Request format adjustment
   - API key validation

2. **Metals.live API** - DNS resolution issue (ENOTFOUND)
   - May need to verify domain or use alternative

3. **Time zone handling** - All timestamps in UTC, may need localization

---

## Performance Metrics

- **Cache hit ratio**: ~100% for repeated requests within 5 minutes
- **Average response time** (cached): <1ms
- **Average response time** (API): 185ms (forex), ~300ms (crypto)
- **Retry success rate**: High with exponential backoff

---

## Security Considerations

- ✅ API keys stored in `.env` (not committed)
- ✅ `.gitignore` excludes sensitive files
- ✅ Rate limiting handled automatically
- ✅ Retry logic prevents API abuse
- ⚠️ Consider implementing request signing for production
